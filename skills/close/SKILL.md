# close: exit gate

Run this when you stop, for any reason. Each rule came from a session that ended wrongly.

## 1. Choose the mode

Run `ws-delivery-status` to verify physical delivery state before ending.

To declare **Complete**, you MUST run:
```bash
ws-delivery-status --assert-complete --reality-probe "<command>"
```

| Condition | Mode | Required Action / Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| `ws-delivery-status --assert-complete ...` exit 0, no service impact | **Complete** | Production disposition `none` |
| `ws-delivery-status` exit 0 (Stage 1 only, no reality probe or probe failed) | **Suspend** | Report state strictly as `Stage 1 Landed (Unverified)`; issue stays open |
| `ws-delivery-status --assert-complete ...` exit 0 + service impact, owner gave "deploy" + prod verified | **Complete** | Production disposition `deployed` |
| `ws-delivery-status` exit 0 + service impact, no owner answer yet | **Suspend** | Production disposition `pending` (issue stays open) |
| `ws-delivery-status` exit 1 (PR in review) | **Suspend** | Report state strictly as `In review` with PR URL |
| `ws-delivery-status` exit 2 (unmerged branch, draft changes, or probe failed) | **Suspend** | Run `auto` to merge or write handover |

Unmerged work is never Complete. Merge to main without a verified Business Reality Probe is never Complete.
Do not close the issue and do not delete the worktree in Suspend.
Never declare complete or done when `ws-delivery-status` exits non-zero.
Complete also needs the predecessor gone: each file, branch, worktree, stash or flag that this issue's change replaces is deleted, or the issue states why it stays. Delete only what this issue created or replaced. Never delete what another session's worktree or stash owns.
Unpushed commits are invisible to everyone else. One log feature lived 3 days on a never-pushed branch
while the docs described it as existing. Push the branch or write it into the handover.

## 2. Prove the running process is new

Skip this step when no process serves the change. Otherwise compare the process age with the file edit time.

```bash
python3 - "$FILE" "$PID" <<'PROBE'
import os, re, subprocess, sys, time

path, pid = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
age = time.time() - os.stat(path).st_mtime
r = subprocess.run(["ps", "-o", "etime=", "-p", pid], capture_output=True, text=True)
raw = r.stdout.strip()
m = re.fullmatch(r"(?:(?:(\d+)-)?(\d+):)?(\d+):(\d+)", raw)
print(f"file changed {age:.0f}s ago; ps reports etime={raw!r}")
if r.returncode != 0 or not m:
    print("verdict: UNDETERMINED (ps gave no parseable etime: process gone, no permission, or other platform format)")
    sys.exit(2)
d, h, mi, sec = (int(x or 0) for x in m.groups())
elapsed = ((d * 24 + h) * 60 + mi) * 60 + sec
print(f"process running for {elapsed}s")
print("verdict: STALE (process is older than the edit, so it runs old code)" if elapsed > age
      else "verdict: FRESH (process started after the edit)")
PROBE
```

Use `ps -o etime=`. The keyword `etimes` exists only in procps-ng: macOS prints its keyword list to stdout and the output looks like a measurement.
Report "cannot measure" as UNDETERMINED. Never turn it into "not stale".

## 2.5 Business Reality Probe (verify the goal in physical reality)

Merge to main is Stage 1 only. Before declaring **Complete**, you MUST execute a physical reality probe proving the change works in reality:

1. **Data / Metrics / Factor tasks**: Execute live DB, API, or MCP query. Assert `records > 0`, `status == available` (reject `unavailable` or `lines: 0`).
2. **Refactoring / Code Slimming tasks**: Run physical diff/metrics (`wc -l` before/after or token counts) proving net reduction of complexity or lines (reject peripheral lint fixes).
3. **Pipeline / Benchmark tasks**: Execute against real non-empty input datasets or statements (reject 0-transaction / empty accounts).
4. **Bugfix tasks**: Reproduce against the original failing trigger payload and verify it now succeeds.

If the reality probe fails, is empty, or is unperformed, the session MUST exit as **Suspend** (`Stage 1 Landed`), never Complete.

## 3. Production gatekeeper (service changes)

Merge, staging deploy, and production deploy are three separate stages. Report all three with evidence, then ask:

```text
[PROD GATEKEEPER]
- Stage 1 merge: release tag vX.Y.Z = commit <sha>
- Stage 2 staging: run <url>, soak <duration>, health <result>
- Stage 3 production: image <digest>, watchdog <state>
Authorize production deployment of vX.Y.Z? Reply "deploy" or "hold".
```

- Claim "deployed" only with an evidence chain: image digest, ledger entry, and a real end-to-end probe (the real browser or TUI).
  The owner asked twice "are you sure the last version is deployed?" Find the proof, then answer.
- Only a production change requires owner approval, with the owner present (owner instruction, 2026-10-06). Ask once, then finish the non-production close.
  Closing in silence is forbidden.
- Without an answer, keep the issue open. Reopen it if the merge closed it. Create the label `prod-pending` if it is missing.
  Comment `prod disposition: pending` with the release tag or commit SHA, and add the label.
- A "deploy" covers only the release it names. Immediately before dispatch, the owner must answer you live in this session; an earlier or relayed answer is not enough. Without approval, do not deploy production.
- Refuse bare "deploy" keywords without release tags or commits. If the owner replies only "deploy", request explicit disambiguation naming the target: "Please confirm release target: deploy vX.Y.Z". Without explicit approval, do not deploy production.
- After "deploy", you own the whole loop, including the physical check. Never ask the owner to run a command.

## 4. Suspend: handover and issue

Write the handover with four parts. Include the exact next command.

1. **Done:** commit SHAs, changed files, tests that passed.
2. **Blocked:** the cause (CI, open design question, a fact only the owner can supply).
   List an owner action only when it needs the owner's hands or presence.
   Examples: a production deploy, a setting that the agent token cannot change, a credential root.
   A merge, a head approval, or a review of non-production work is never an owner action. If a gate demands one, the gate is the defect.
   The exception is an edit that the production reservation keeps with the owner permanently.
   Only three such holds exist: the reservation's self-guard, infra2's owner-held set (rule 6) and dev_env's `ci.yml` hold.
   Name the missing physical fact, then do the agent work that supplies it.
3. **Decisions:** contracts you fixed and assumptions you overturned.
4. **Next:** the first command for the next session.

```bash
ws-bm write-note --folder memory/handover --tags handover --title "Handover: issue-<N> <slug>" --content "..."
```

Also update the issue with the same four parts. Search for an existing issue first. Create one only when none matches.
Commands for this machine are in `local.md`.

## 5. Complete: clean up

1. Kill every background task, watcher, and subagent bound to the worktree.
   Check for busy files with a 15-second timeout guard:
   ```bash
   python3 - "$WORKTREE" <<'EOF'
   import subprocess, sys
   wt = sys.argv[1]
   try:
       r = subprocess.run(["lsof", "+D", wt], capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=15)
       if r.returncode == 0 and r.stdout.strip():
           print("WARNING: Worktree has active processes:\n" + r.stdout.strip())
   except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
       print("WARNING: lsof timed out after 15s (filesystem may be remote/virtual); skipping busy check.")
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"WARNING: lsof check failed ({e}); skipping.")
   EOF
   ```
   Removing a tree under a running task corrupts it.
2. Remove the worktree safely with unlock and force fallbacks:
   ```bash
   git worktree unlock "../<repo>_issue<N>_<slug>" 2>/dev/null || true
   git worktree remove --force "../<repo>_issue<N>_<slug>" || git worktree prune
   ```
3. Delete the merged branch when `gh pr view <n> --json state,headRefOid,isCrossRepository` shows `MERGED`, no cross-repository head, and `git rev-parse <branch>` equals `headRefOid`.
   Run `git branch -d` first. A squash or rebase merge can make it refuse. The equal tip proves that nothing is lost, so `-D` is then safe. A host gate that blocks `-D` stays in force: leave the local branch and say so in the handover.
   Delete the remote branch only at that tip: `git push --force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<headRefOid> origin --delete <branch>`. GitHub may have deleted it already.
   The PR keeps `refs/pull/<n>/head`, so the commits stay recoverable. A different tip means commits that the PR did not merge: open a new PR for them or write them into the handover.
4. Close the issue with the merge proof when the production disposition is `none`, `deployed`, or `hold`.
   With `pending`, keep it open (section 3).
5. Delete scratch files. Record each leftover TODO in the handover.

## 6. Route each lesson (distill)

Every finding from the session has exactly one destination, or an announced discard. Use a read-only agent to decide.
The agent that wrote the code does not judge its own lessons.

Ask in order. The first YES decides:

1. True only this time (one SHA, one count, one temp path)? **Discard, and say so in the report.**
2. Can an automatic check catch it? **Build the check. Do not write a rule.** A red assertion works every time. Prose works when read.
3. Would it change a future judgment? **Write it as a criterion.** Choose the tier by what it depends on:
   - holds on any machine: Root rules;
   - holds only with this environment's shared infrastructure: Workspace rules;
   - holds only for this project's goal: Repo rules.

   If you cannot name the tier, you do not yet know what it depends on. Do not write it.
4. Unfinished work, or state for someone else? **Issue or handover.**
5. A location of an external thing (dashboard, ticket, log path)? **Memory reference.**
6. True only for this checkout, or tier unclear? **Put it in the local holding area** for the read-only agent to place.

Red lines:

- **R1** No rule without the measurement that triggered it: which session, what went wrong, what it cost.
- **R2** Resident text holds criteria only. Move steps, lists, and templates to a skill and leave a pointer.
- **R3** The distiller is not the executor.
- **R4** Discard out loud.
- **R5** One invariant lives in one tier. Copies drift. Skills may restate a criterion but must point back to the owner.
  (2026-09-22: "the president writes no code" lived in two tiers, and one copy missed the stop condition added that day.)
- **R6** A pointer must resolve to the same literal string in the target. A pointer to a dropped invariant disguises the loss as convergence.

A finding that is both a criterion and unfinished work becomes two records. One record inside an issue dies when the issue closes.

## 7. Report

Report in the owner's language, in a short table. Show the mode, merge proof, verification that ran on which machine,
the oracles you did not touch, the sample size, the data age, and the discarded findings.

End with the **Falsification Probe** instead of formulaic prose:
- **Target**: What physical probe would expose if this change were secretly broken, empty, or un-deployed?
- **Command**: `<exact probe command>`
- **Physical Output**: `<raw stdout snippet proving non-empty real-world effect>`
